    ## Authentication API


    The authentication API returns an authentication token that you can present

    when your integration client software uses other Toast APIs. For more

    information about authentication, see [the Toast Developer

    Guide](https://doc.toasttab.com/doc/devguide/authentication.html).


    ## Menus API


    Returns information about a restaurant's menus.


    _Important:_ Ordering integrations should use menus API V3. Other integration types should continue to use menus API V2 until further notice. See <a href="https://doc.toasttab.com/doc/devguide/apiComparingMenusAPIV2AndV3.html">Comparing menus API V2 and V3</a> for more information.


    ## Orders API


    The orders API includes operations that create, update, and retrieve information about restaurant

    guest orders.


    Information on orders includes the checks, items ordered,

    prices, payments, discounts, and customer data.


    You can create a new order. The orders API includes an operation to retrieve the order prices before you `POST` the order.


    You can add items to an existing check.


    The orders API also allows you to retrieve payment information for the order and add a credit card payment to the order.

    You cannot update an existing payment, but you can update the tip amount.


    For delivery orders, you can update the delivery information.


    You can retrieve the applicable discounts for an order, and then add a discount to a menu item selection or a check.


    The orders API supports email addresses that: 
      - Are up to 53 characters long. 
      - Start with the email prefix, ends with the email domain name, where the prefix and domain are separated by an @. 
      - Use the following supported characters:
        - a-z
        - A-Z
        - 0-9
        - _ (underscore)
        - International characters are not supported

    ## Labor API


    Toast labor API is a set of REST web services that you can use to 

    manage the employees, jobs, and shifts for your restaurant. The 

    labor API is intended for software engineers, managers, and 

    technical staff who are responsible for integrating third-party 

    systems with the Toast platform.

    ## Restaurants API


    Returns information about the configuration of restaurant.

        `lastUpdated` date and time. While this recommendation applies to all

        Calculates the check price amounts, tax amounts, and service
        charges for an `Order` object you supply as a _required message

        The `prices` endpoint validates the order you
        submit to ensure all referenced data exists and that you include
        item selections in the expected structure with all required modifier
        options.

        Some values that would be present in the response data when
        creating an order are not present in the response data for the `prices`
        endpoint. For example, the order GUID is not set because the
        Toast platform does not create persistent data for the order.

        The calculated price can change between requests to the
        `prices` endpoint with the same `Order` object if enough time
        passes between the requests. The difference in price is
        possible because the restaurant configuration can change and
        because some pricing configuration is based on time and date
        schedules.

        Deletes a restaurant employee record by marking the record as 
        deleted. A deleted employee cannot log in at the restaurant or 
        open new time entries.

        If you `GET` an employee record that has been deleted, its 
        `deleted` value is `true` and its `deletedDate` value contains 
        the date and time the record was deleted. 

        If you delete an employee that has already been deleted then 
        the result is successful (200) and no change is made.

        The deleted record appears in the list of deleted employees for 
        the restaurant in Toast Web. From the 
        list of deleted employees, you can enable a deleted record so 
        that the employee can use it again. Information about deleted 
        employees remains available in reports.

        You cannot delete employees who have open time entries (time 
        entries that do not have an out date value).

        * Unarchived employees can sign into the Toast POS.

        * When you unarchive an employee, the employee has all 
          jobs that were previously assigned to them.
        * If an employee had a swipe card for signing into the 
          Toast POS, the swipe card _is not_ re-associated with 
          the employee when you unarchive them.

        If you unarchive an employee who will take a different 
        role than the one they had when they were archived, you 
        must update the employee's jobs list and verify that the 
        employee should continue to sign into Toast Web.

            Controls whether the response includes archived time entries, when

            using the `startDate` and `endDate` parameters.


            **Important**: this parameter _has no effect_ if you use the

            `modifiedStartDate` and `modifiedEndDate` parameters or the

            `businessDate` parameter to select time entries.


            * Querying by modified date range _always_ returns archived time entries.

            * Querying by businessDate _never_ returns archived time entries.


            This parameter is optional and the default value is `false`.
